1. Web Application Sends a Request
Your web app (e.g., a frontend Angular/React app) makes a request to a known endpoint, such as https://apidev.ibm.com, instead of directly calling backend APIs.
The web app often includes necessary headers like authorization tokens (e.g., OAuth token, API key).
 
 
2. API Gateway (Apigee) Receives the Request
Apigee acts as an API Gateway and receives the request from your web app.

It:
Authenticates the request: Checks tokens or credentials to verify that the client (your web app) is authorized to use the API.
Validates the request: Ensures the input parameters, headers, and payload meet API requirements.
Applies policies: Implements rate-limiting, logging, or other rules.
Transforms the request (optional): Modifies the request format (e.g., URL, headers, or payload) to match the actual backend API.
 
 
3. API Gateway Forwards the Request
After processing, Apigee forwards the request to the specific backend API (e.g., https://actual-api.example.com).
This routing is configured in Apigee as a proxy:
The backend API is hidden from the web app.
The web app interacts only with Apigee’s public-facing URL.
 
 
4. Backend API Processes the Request
The actual backend API performs the requested operation (e.g., retrieving data or processing user input).
It sends the response back to Apigee.
 
 
5. API Gateway Processes the Response
Apigee receives the response from the backend API.
Optionally, it might modify or format the response before sending it back to the client (e.g., redacting sensitive information, converting formats like XML → JSON).
Logs the transaction for analytics or debugging.
 
 
6. Web App Receives the Response
Apigee sends the processed response back to your web app.
The web app displays the data or takes the appropriate action based on the response.
 
 
Benefits of Using Apigee
Centralized Gateway:
Your web app interacts with a single URL (https://apidev.ibm.com) instead of managing multiple backend APIs.
Enhanced Security:
Backend APIs are not directly exposed to the public. Only Apigee's public-facing endpoints are visible.
Apigee handles authentication, token verification, and even encryption.
Rate Limiting & Quotas:
Limits the number of requests from a single client, protecting the backend APIs from being overloaded.
Request Transformation:
Adapts requests to match the format required by the backend APIs, so your web app doesn't need to handle these transformations.
Analytics & Monitoring:
Provides insights into usage, errors, and performance through dashboards.

Workflow Breakdown
1. Code Commit (Trigger)
A developer pushes code changes to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
This action triggers a Jenkins build via a webhook or a polling mechanism.
 
 
2. Jenkins Build
Build Process:
Jenkins pulls the updated code from the Git repository.
The pipeline runs the following tasks:
Code Compilation: If applicable (e.g., Java, Go, etc.).
Unit Testing: Ensures the code changes pass predefined tests.
Containerization:
Jenkins uses a Dockerfile to build a Docker image from the codebase.
The image contains your application and its dependencies.
Docker Image Upload:
The Docker image is tagged (e.g., app:1.0.0) and pushed to JFrog Artifactory:
bashCopyEditdocker login <artifactory-url>
docker tag <image> <artifactory-url>/<repo>/<image-name>:<tag>
docker push <artifactory-url>/<repo>/<image-name>:<tag>
 
3. GitOps File Update
GitOps:
GitOps relies on a Git repository to define and manage the desired state of your Kubernetes infrastructure.
The pipeline updates the GitOps configuration files (e.g., Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, or Kustomize files) to point to the new Docker image version:
The updated files are committed back to the GitOps repository.
yamlCopyEditcontainers:- name: my-appimage: <artifactory-url>/<repo>/<image-name>:<tag>
 
4. Spinnaker Deployment
Role of Spinnaker:
Spinnaker continuously monitors the GitOps repository for changes.
When the GitOps file is updated with the new image tag, Spinnaker triggers a deployment pipeline.
Deployment Pipeline:
Validation: Ensures the updated configuration is valid.
Canary Deployment (optional): Deploys the updated application to a small subset of pods for testing.
Full Rollout: If tests pass, Spinnaker rolls out the changes across the cluster.
 
 
5. Deployment to Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO)
Red Hat OpenShift:
ARO is a managed Kubernetes service running on Microsoft Azure, optimized for Red Hat's OpenShift platform.
Spinnaker applies the updated GitOps configuration to the OpenShift cluster using Kubernetes APIs.
Pods are updated with the new Docker image from Artifactory.
Kubernetes Rolling Update:
OpenShift performs a rolling update, ensuring zero downtime:
Old pods are gradually replaced with new pods running the updated image.
Load balancers redirect traffic to the new pods once they are ready.
 
 
End-to-End Workflow Recap
Code Commit:
Developer pushes code to Git → triggers Jenkins.
Build & Push:
Jenkins builds a Docker image → pushes it to JFrog Artifactory.
GitOps Update:
Jenkins updates GitOps files with the new image tag.
Deploy via Spinnaker:
Spinnaker detects changes → deploys updated configuration to Azure OpenShift.
Run on ARO Pods:
OpenShift rolls out the new build to production pods.
 
 
Benefits of This Pipeline
Automation:
The entire process, from code commit to deployment, is automated.
Version Control:
GitOps ensures that every deployment configuration is versioned and traceable.
Security:
JFrog Artifactory ensures private and secure Docker image storage.
Scalability:
Kubernetes (ARO) handles scaling and reliability.
Flexibility:
Spinnaker supports advanced deployment strategies like blue/green or canary.
 
 
Comparison of Webhooks vs Polling
 
Feature	Webhook	Polling
Trigger Mechanism	Push-based (repository initiates)	Pull-based (Jenkins initiates)
Speed	Immediate	Delayed (depends on interval)
Resource Usage	Low	Higher (frequent checks)
Setup	Requires webhook configuration	Simple, no external setup
Scalability	Better for large projects	May cause strain on Jenkins
Use Case	When webhooks are supported	For legacy systems or no webhook support
